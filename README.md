# gpt-dall-e-whisper
An attempt to build a speech to whisper to gpt, to voice and image to have an interactive conversation with my son, Thomas.

Run, run.py and open the index.html and it should listen and respond using gpt and openai voice, then it should also generate an image to keep the user engaged.
I'm a noob, any suggestions would be awesome :D
